# SaturnV-Lua-Guide
A Guide on how to make your own Lua Scripts inside of the SaturnV Mod menu for GTA V Legacy (SP),

# Important
I am yet to finish the native namespaces "HUD", "PED", and "VEHICLE"
Those 3 are the last ones i need to add before the lua intergration gets fully released

Also, here are 3 namespaces i wont be publishing and why, "NETWORK", "NETSHOPPING, "MONEY".
I wont be publishing those because they are all releated to GTA Online, and since this is a single-player menu, it would be a waste of time adding those
