# SaturnV-Lua-Guide
A Guide on how to make your own Lua Scripts inside of the SaturnV Mod menu for GTA V Legacy (SP),
First, you can either press ``` win + r ``` then type %appdata% then scroll down until you find SaturnV (You must run the menu once in GTA for it to appear), or go into the menu and press on SaturnV > Lua Scripts > Open Lua Folder to go directly to it. Once you have found the lua folder, right click inside the folder and click on new file, this will make a txt file, rename that file to anything you want, but be sure it is a .lua file, not a Script.lua.txt, a Script.lua. After you have done this, if you haven't download VS Code (Not visual studio, visual studio CODE) go to this site here https://code.visualstudio.com/download to download it. Double click on the file, if it doesn't immediatly open VS Code, click on the VS Code option, if no option for VS Code appears, make sure you have installed it properly, i will not be providing a guide for vs code installation. Once you are in VS Code, start typing your script, and you should be able to find it in SaturnV > Lua Scripts > Your script name. Open your script name, and click on "Toggle" to start it up, and watch the magic happen.
To get started with making functions in your script, visit ``` GUI.md ``` for intstructions on how to make UI for your lua script
If anything goes wrong with running your script, or your script doesn't appear, notify me in the discord, which will be in my GitHub profile description.
