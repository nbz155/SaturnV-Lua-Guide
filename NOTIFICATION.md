# Notifications

Notifications are how you communicate to the user. I have not made a custom notification UI yet, i will in the future but for now im using GTA's notification feature
If you dont want to write your notification out by hand, you can use my API below

# notification.show("Message")
To do this, all you have to do is replace Message with your text, then your done.
If you want to make your text a different colour, you could do something like
```notification.show("~r~Red~w~White")```
